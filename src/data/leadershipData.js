We are a premier AICTE, Government of India approved Business School established in 1969 by the legendary Marketing & Management Guru, Late Dr. Jagjit Singh. Since our inception over five and a half decades ago, the institution has been a frontrunner, consistently striving to innovate and create world-class intellectual capital. I am delighted to announce that we have recently joined the AACSB Business Education Alliance as a member institution.

The foundation stone of our purpose-built campus in the lush green Qutab Institutional Area, South of IIT, New Delhi, was laid 25 years ago by the then Prime Minister Shri I K Gujral Ji, and we opened our doors in the new millennium of 2000. Since then, we at IMM have undergone various revamping stages to adapt to the rapidly evolving learning environments.

With over 20,000 alumni spread across the globe, we at IMM achieve near 100% placements for our postgraduate students.

Our Corporate Resource Centre works tirelessly to ensure national and international placements for our students.

Our excellent placement record has furthered our mission to enhance the knowledge bandwidth of our students, leading to the launch of a Global Immersion Program for our PGDM students, providing live online training programs from various global AACSB accredited partner institutions, with more initiatives underway.

This innovative approach has empowered our students with global knowledge, leading to broader placement opportunities and the institution winning over 15 awards and accolades.

Join our ever-growing successful fraternity as we prepare for Education 4.0.`,
